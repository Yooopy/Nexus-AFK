# English:

**Open Nexus and enter a competition
Then get a turret from the store and place it on the spell Q 
(if there is no need to change it). After that, go to the place 
where you want to AFK. Specify the duration and click OK. 
Now you have ten seconds to enter the game and let the program do its work. 
that's it! If you want to exit, move the mouse to the corner of the screen or come to the program and click exit.**
